Rewriting alpha blog project in rails 7.

[Original repository (rails 6)](https://github.com/PedroDrago/alpha-blog)

<p>This project is from a ROR course im enrolled with and my first project with backend on rails.</p>

<p> <strong>P.S. </strong> Since my focus on the beggining of the project was build a CRUD, i didn't use scaffold for studying purposes.</p>

<h3>App deployed!</h3>
