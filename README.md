Rewriting alpha blog project in rails 7.

[Original repository (rails 6)](https://github.com/PedroDrago/alpha-blog)

<p>This is my first first ruby on rails project.</p>


<p> <strong>P.S. </strong> Since my focus on the beggining of the project was build a CRUD, i didn't use scaffold for studying purposes.</p>

<h3>App deployed!</h3>
